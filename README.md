CGViz is an HTML/CSS/JS application for interactive, step-by-step visualizations of classic Computational Geometry topics and algorithms. It is designed for exploration and teaching, making it useful for classroom demonstrations or self-study. The web app pre-computes algorithm steps (where applicable) and allows you to play them back, step forward/backward, inspect intermediate states, and export visuals for slides or handouts. It also provides relevant resources and references for each topic.

#### Features

- CGViz provides playback controls (play/pause, next/prev, speed control) to explore algorithm steps, including simple data structure states, where applicable.
- You can exports visuals in multiple formats: PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF and animated GIFs (single-click export via the UI). GIF recording supports both live-record and step-based exports.
- The app supports pan/zoom and has a random input generator for many algorithms (configurable input distributions, counts, etc.).
- There are several keyboard-friendly controls to quickly configure and navigate the visualizations (see below).

## Keyboard shortcuts

The app exposes several keyboard shortcuts (exact bindings are implemented in `js/main.js`). These are the primary keys, you can use, while the canvas is focused.

| Key(s)             | Action                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `h` / `H`          | Step: Previous                              |
| `l` / `L`          | Step: Next                                  |
| `k` / `K`, `Space` | Play / Pause (toggle)                       |
| `j` / `J`          | Stop / Pause autoplay                       |
| `c` / `C`          | Clear current inputs                        |
| `v` / `V`          | Randomize inputs (opens/applies randomizer) |
| `s` / `S`          | Focus the algorithm selection dropdown      |
| `i` / `I`          | Toggle Instructions / Info panel            |
| `t` / `T`          | Toggle canvas informational text            |
| `f` / `F`          | Toggle focus-canvas mode (hide overlays)    |
| `r` / `R`          | Reset canvas view (pan/zoom reset)          |
| `+` / `=`          | Zoom in                                     |
| `-`                | Zoom out                                    |
| `,` / `<`          | Decrease autoplay speed                     |
| `.` / `>`          | Increase autoplay speed                     |
| Arrow keys         | Pan canvas view                             |

#### Notes

1. The autoplay speed also affects the frame recording speed when exporting GIFs via the step-based method.
2. If Ctrl / Alt / Shift or Meta are held, the global handler typically ignores the key to preserve OS/browser shortcuts.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! You can explore the [open issues](https://github.com/JeS24/CGViz/issues) for ideas or share your own suggestions. Please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the project structure, contribution guidelines and details on how to add a new algorithm.

## Local development / Serving

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS site, but opening `index.html` directly in a browser may not work, as some features require a local HTTP server. Recommended options are below (you may need to install Python or Node.js/npm first):

- Python 3 (built-in HTTP server):

  - From the project root, run:
    - For `bash/zsh` (Linux/macOS) or `PowerShell` (Windows): `python -m http.server 8000`
    - Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

- npm (http-server):

  - Install once: `npm install -g http-server`
  - Serve: `http-server -c-1` (disables caching) or `http-server -p 8000` to set port.

- VS Code: Live Server extension
  - Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and click "Go Live" or right-click `index.html` -> "Open with Live Server".

#### Notes:

- Use a modern desktop browser (Firefox, Brave, Edge, Chrome) for best results. Mobile is partially supported, but not fully responsive yet.
- If you run into CORS or file:// issues, use one of the server options above.
